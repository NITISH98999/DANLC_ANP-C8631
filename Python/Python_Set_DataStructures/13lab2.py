# 2. Write a Python program to Return a set of elements present in Set A or B, but
# not both.
# Input:
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# Output:
# {20, 70, 10, 60}
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
a = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print(a)
